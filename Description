I will be programming multiplayer chess, which is one of the most widely played board game in the world, for my 15112 final project.
I will use pygame library.
The user interface will consist of 3 screens. In the first screen there will be two options. 
1- Play game
2-Rules
Play game will take us to the main window of the game and rules will take us to another screen which consists of all rules of chess.
By the first checkpoint I will implement most of the code. The rules for pawn promotion and pieces taking other pieces will be implemented
by the second checkpoint
